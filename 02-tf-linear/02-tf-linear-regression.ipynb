We'll create a model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Here's the training data:\n",

    "\n",
    "![linear-regression-graph](https://i.imgur.com/4DJ9f8X.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *learning* part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights `w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2` by looking at the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data (i.e. to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall and humidity). This is done by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called *gradient descent*."
